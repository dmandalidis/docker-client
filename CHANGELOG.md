### Breaking changes

* `ResourceRequirements#reservations` changed type from `Resources` to the newly-introduced
`Reservations`. The reasoning behind this change is that the `Resources` type cannot
hold the necessary data for supporting swarm generic resources.

* Support for providing any JAX-RS 2.1 client implementation has been added to avoid 
conflicts in flat classpath environments where another JAX-RS implementations (e.g. RESTeasy)
are unavoidably present or where an externally-managed `Client` needs to be shared. This led
all Jersey dependencies to become optional and clients projects must define them explicitly
if they need to use the bundled `JerseyDockerClientBuilder`. More specifically, client 
projects are affected in the following ways:
    * They must include the necessary Jersey dependencies in their `pom.xml` as follows
    ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.glassfish.jersey.core</groupId>
            <artifactId>jersey-client</artifactId>
            <version>2.30.1</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.glassfish.jersey.inject</groupId>
            <artifactId>jersey-hk2</artifactId>
            <version>2.30.1</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.glassfish.jersey.connectors</groupId>
            <artifactId>jersey-apache-connector</artifactId>
            <version>2.30.1</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.glassfish.jersey.media</groupId>
            <artifactId>jersey-media-json-jackson</artifactId>
            <version>2.30.1</version>
        </dependency>
    ```
    * Public constructors of `DefaultDockerClient` have been dropped in favour of clear 
    responsibilities between the builder and the client itself:
        * If you were using `DefaultDockerClient#DefaultDockerClient(URI)` use `new JerseyDockerClientBuilder().uri(uri).build()` instead
        * If you were using `DefaultDockerClient#DefaultDockerClient(String)` use `new JerseyDockerClientBuilder().uri(uri).build()` instead
        * If you were using `DefaultDockerClient#DefaultDockerClient(URI, DockerCertificatesStore)` use `new JerseyDockerClientBuilder().uri(uri).dockerCertificates(dockerCertificatesStore).build()` instead
    * `DefaultDockerClient#fromEnv` has been moved to `JerseyDockerClientBuilder`
        * If you were using `DefaultDockerClient#fromEnv` use `new JerseyDockerClientBuilder().fromEnv` instead

    * `DefaultDockerClient#builder` has been removed
        * If you were using `DefaultDockerClient#builder` use `new JerseyDockerClientBuilder()` instead

    * `DockerClient#events` no longer throws a `DockerException` wrapping an `IOException`

    * Builder `requestEntityProcessing` has changed to use a new enum shipped by the DockerClient and renamed to `entityProcessing`

    * Selective per-request unlimited read timeout has been dropped. The reason for this is that there's no standard way to 
    do it and we didn't want to create a new `Client` in such methods

    * `InterruptedIOException` is now always wrapped to `DockerTimeoutException`

* Shading support has been dropped as a side-effect of providing API consistency between
different client builders.

* `DockerRequestException` has stopped holding the response body at all cases. This 
is because RESTeasy (compared to Jersey) closes the response when an exception is thrown, 
hiding the actual error when trying to read it. The specification is still 
[unclear](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues/736) about whether JAXRS 
implementations must close the response or not.

## 3.0.1

* Revert incorrectly removed methods (fixes #111)

## 3.0.0

This release is mostly a Guava-exclusion release since several of its used features
has been incorporated to Java 8+.

Additionally, although not expected to cause any issues, the `com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-jaxb-annotations`
has been excluded and thus stopped being pulled as a transitive dependency of `docker-client`.

* `HostConfig.Builder#appendBinds*` methods removed
* `HostConfig.Builder#binds(final Bind... binds)` method does not ignore null binds anymore
* `Immutable*` types removed from public fields
* `EventStream` now implements `java.util.Iterator<Event>`
* `EventStream#close` and `LogStream#close` can now throw `IOException`
* `LogStream#attach(OutputStream, OutputStream, boolean)` method removed. Methods should
not close streams they do not manage.

* Bump bcpkix-jdk15on from 1.63 to 1.64

## 2.0.0

This release is the last step in moving away from the original project. That is,
this is a breaking release as all `com.spotify.docker` packages have been renamed
to `org.mandas.docker` and, normally, A find-and-replace would do the work for you.
Last but not least, all deprecated methods and redundant API version checks have
been removed.

* Repackaging to org.mandas (fixes #8)

## 1.0.1

This is the first release after forking the project. The only notable changes are 
the switch from `com.spotify` to `org.mandas` groupId and [the upgrade to Jackson 2.9.10][].
Users of the original project should be able to switch by simply replacing the groupId
and the version (otherwise it's a bug, triggering an immediate patch release)

[the upgrade to Jackson 2.9.10]: https://github.com/dmandalidis/docker-client/issues/3
