# Change Log

## 3.0.0 (unreleased)

This release is mostly a Guava-exclusion release since several of its used features
has been incorporated to Java 8+.

Additionally, although not expected to cause any issues, the `com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-jaxb-annotations`
has been excluded and it stopped being pulled as a transitive dependency of `docker-client`.

### Breaking changes

* `RegistryConfigs.Builder#addConfig` does not ignore null `RegistryAuth` values anymore
* `HostConfig.Builder#appendBinds*` methods removed
* `HostConfig.Builder#binds(final Bind... binds)` method does not ignore null binds anymore
* `Immutable*` types removed from public fields
* `EventStream` now implements `java.util.Iterator<Event>`
* `EventStream#close` and `LogStream#close` can now throw `IOException`
* `LogStream#attach(OutputStream, OutputStream, boolean)` method removed. Methods should
not close streams they do not manage.
* `LogStream#attach(OutputStream, OutputStream)` can now throw `IOException`

## 2.0.2

## 2.0.0

This release is the last step in moving away from the original project. That is,
this is a breaking release as all `com.spotify.docker` packages have been renamed
to `org.mandas.docker` and, normally, A find-and-replace would do the work for you.
Last but not least, all deprecated methods and redundant API version checks have
been removed.

## 1.0.1

This is the first release after forking the project. The only notable changes are 
the switch from `com.spotify` to `org.mandas` groupId and [the upgrade to Jackson 2.9.10][].
Users of the original project should be able to switch by simply replacing the groupId
and the version (otherwise it's a bug, triggering an immediate patch release)

[the upgrade to Jackson 2.9.10]: https://github.com/dmandalidis/docker-client/issues/3
